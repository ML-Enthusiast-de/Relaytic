# Migration Map

This file tracks explicit compatibility boundaries while the repository continues moving toward the final Relaytic product surface.

## Public Naming

- product name: `Relaytic`
- public package: `relaytic`
- public CLI: `relaytic`

Legacy `Corr2Surrogate` naming exists only where compatibility is still being preserved deliberately.

## Compatibility Surface

Current temporary compatibility promises:

- legacy Python imports rooted at `corr2surrogate` continue through a narrow shim
- legacy `C2S_*` environment variables may still be accepted as fallbacks in some runtime paths

These are compatibility mechanisms, not active public product surfaces.

## Preferred Environment Variables

Use:

- `RELAYTIC_CONFIG_PATH`
- `RELAYTIC_PROVIDER`
- `RELAYTIC_PROFILE`
- `RELAYTIC_MODEL`
- `RELAYTIC_ENDPOINT`
- `RELAYTIC_API_KEY`

Avoid introducing new references to:

- `C2S_CONFIG_PATH`
- `C2S_PROVIDER`
- `C2S_PROFILE`
- `C2S_MODEL`
- `C2S_ENDPOINT`
- `C2S_API_KEY`

## Module Mapping

- `src/corr2surrogate/*` -> `src/relaytic/*`
- `corr2surrogate.ui.cli` -> `relaytic.ui.cli`
- `corr2surrogate.security.git_guard` -> `relaytic.security.git_guard`

## Boundary Additions By Slice

### Slice 03

- introduced the canonical package boundary `src/relaytic/investigation/`
- introduced the public command `relaytic investigate`
- tightened compatibility wrappers so repo-local forwarding is explicit rather than accidental

### Slice 04

- introduced the canonical package boundary `src/relaytic/intake/`
- introduced the public commands `relaytic intake interpret`, `relaytic intake show`, and `relaytic intake questions`
- expanded the artifact boundary to include autonomous intake artifacts such as `autonomy_mode.json`, `clarification_queue.json`, and `assumption_log.json`

## Removal Criteria

The remaining compatibility layer can be removed when all of the following are true:

1. tests no longer depend on `corr2surrogate` imports
2. docs and examples no longer mention legacy package paths except historical notes
3. runtime paths no longer require `C2S_*` fallbacks
4. the next stable slices no longer rely on compatibility forwarding
